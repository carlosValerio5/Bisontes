## Summary
Climate change brings about new complexities to consider for maintaining the wellbeing of society and the environment in cities. Natural resources, ecosystems, and existing infrastructure all must be monitored to ensure human quality of life remains high. Your challenge is to demonstrate how an urban planner can use NASA Earth observation data to develop smart strategies for city growth that maintain both the wellbeing of people and the environment.

## Objectives
- Develop a project plan informed by NASA Earth science data that not only improves quality of life for residents of a fast-growing city, but takes environmental considerations into account.

## On a Serious Note...
Monterrey is located in a zone with predominantly dry and semi-dry climate, in the previous decades, the regional tendencies show that maximum temperatures are increasing in the span of 1985 to 2018, while annual precipitation totals don't reveal a growing tendency.

### How climate change affects Monterrey
- Intensified heat waves.
- Drought.
- Extreme rain events, floods.
- Urban vulnerability.

### How urbanism helps improve quality of life
- Reconnection with nature and natural ecosystems.
- Water resource management.
- Sustainable mobility, decreasing CO2 emissions.
- Inclusive transport, etc...

## Setup
Install all the dependencies. Run:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

From the project root (Bisontes/) run the following command.
```
python -m streamlit run ./app/streamlit_map.py
```
The server should launch and expose the port 8502.
Use you'r favourite browser to access the app.
